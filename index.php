            <p class="light">I have worked in the world of new technologies since the year 1998, I have a solid track record in creating interactive projects.
I have created, participated and maintained websites from a wide variety of styles, from corporate to creation of content managers.
For two years I was responsible for a team of 5 people in the IT department.

I am a sociable person, who considers the fact of knowing a human being the discovery of a unique personal world, this leads us to enjoy communication in all its aspects.</p>
